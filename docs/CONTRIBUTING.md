We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Follow the pull request template
3. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off from maintainers

## Testing Requirements

- Follow TDD principles
- Write tests using JUnit 5 and AssertJ
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Run the full test suite before submitting PR

## Style Guide

Code style is enforced using Checkstyle. Key points:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length is 120 characters
- Methods should be no longer than 40 lines
- Files should be no longer than 2000 lines
- Use final variables where possible
